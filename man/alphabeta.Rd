\title{Show the interaction between the probability of type 1 and type 2 error
The aim is to show the areas based on the null and alternative sampling distributions of the mean
Tests H0: mu = mu0 vs Ha: mu > mu0; H0: mu = mu0 vs Ha: mu < mu0; H0: mu = mu0 vs Ha: mu != mu0}
\usage{
alphabeta(mu0, mua, sigmax, alpha, side, Obs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu0}{the parameter under the null hypothesis}

\item{mua}{the parameter under the alternative hypothesis}

\item{sigmax}{the standard deviation of the sample variance divided by the number of observations}

\item{alpha}{significance level.}

\item{side}{it can be \code{less} if it is one side test and the alternative hypothesis is less than the null hypothesis;
side it can be \code{greater} if it is one side test and the alternative hypothesis is greater than the null hypothesis;
side it can be \code{two.sided} if it is two sides test and the alternative hypothesis can be smaller than the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis can be greater than the null hypothesis; in the plot there is alpha divided by
two and it is represented in light blue the area and it is also specified if it is on the right side or on the left side for the comparison with the beta.}

\item{Obs}{if it is \emph{TRUE} so if it is a specific value than it is possible to see on the same plot the value and the p-value}
}
\value{
Plot for the probability of type 1 and type 2 error as areas. The plots are based on Standardized Normal distributions it is also reported gamma which is the power of the test as 1-beta
