\title{The aim of this function is to show how to represent a quantitative (discrete or continuous) variable numerically and graphically at the same time.}
\usage{
describeQT(
  x,
  x_lab = "",
  title_x = "",
  palette_x = "light blue",
  breaks_x = ceiling(log2(length(x)) + 1),
  plot = "histogram"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the data as a numerical vector}

\item{title_x}{is for the title of the plot}

\item{palette_x}{is for the color of the plot. Default color is light blue but it can be changed}

\item{breaks_x}{is for the histogram: in order to choose the number of groups in it.}

\item{plot}{histogram as default diagram. It is possible to show a boxplot with the mean and the median on the plot.}

\item{place}{is for the legend to placed on top left, top right, bottom right or bottom left.}
