\usage{
area(
  lower.x = -4,
  upper.x = 4,
  mu = 0,
  sigma = 1,
  col = "light blue",
  density = NULL,
  titles = "Area"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lower.x}{the lower bound for a Normal distribution, by default it is equal to -4}

\item{upper.x}{the upper bound for a Normal distribution, by default it is equal to 4}

\item{mu}{the population mean, by default is equal to zero}

\item{sigma}{the standarddeviation of the Normal; by default it is equal to 1}

\item{col}{it is the color of the area under the curve,  by default it is light blue: it can be changed}

\item{density}{draw the kernel density function from the data}

\item{titles}{it the title on the top of the plot}
}
\value{
the area under the standardized Normal distribution
}
