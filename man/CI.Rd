\title{Confidence intervals (CI) for the mean of one population supposed to be Normal, with known and unknown variance;CI based on Binomial distribution and chi-squared distribution.}
\usage{
CI(
  distr = "Standard Normal",
  alpha,
  center = NULL,
  stddev = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  degree.fred = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distr}{by default is intended to use the Normal distribution, otherwise specify \emph{distr="t"} for the t-distribution or \emph{distr="binom"} for the Binomial distribution.}

\item{alpha}{the confidence level;}

\item{center}{the mean of the sample for the Normal or t-distribution, the number of successes divided by the number of observations for the proportion}

\item{stddev}{the standard deviation of the sample for the t-distribution; or the standard deviation of the population in case of normality or the use of central limit theorem for the normal approximation; the standard deviation based on the estimated proportion}

\item{n}{number of observations}

\item{degree.fred}{for the t-distribution: specify the number of degrees of freedom}
}
\value{
the confidence level, the statistical marginal error, the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval.
In case of proportion and the number of observations is greater than 50, it is also added the Yates' continuity. In the plots area are also automatically simulated and shown the 200 sampled confidence interval in order to remind that the parameter of the population is unknown and it is only possible to guess with a certain confidence where the parameter should be.
On the x-axes is also included the number of times the simulation of the boundaries are not including the true parameter.
In case of chi-squared distribution it is produced the density function and the confidence intervals. The focus is on the asymmetric effect on the probabilities.
}
\description{
There are several functions in R for those computations and in particular for the proportion there are several formulas for the correction to normality.
